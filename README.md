# CheckInstalledWindowsUpdates
Script intended for use in an already established monitoring system that monitors the Windows Update log  
All documentation is in the script itself.

#### Compatibility verified by testing on:
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (Windows 7)
- Windows Server 2012 (Windows 8)
- Windows Server 2016 (Windows 10 1803)

Normally only backwards compatibility is an issue, so this is written with PowerShell 2.0 in mind. Should work for future Windows/PowerShell versions without issues.

Does not require administrative rights.

Improvements and pull requests are much appreciated!
