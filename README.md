# CheckInstalledWindowsUpdates
Script intended for use in an already established monitoring system that monitors the Windows Update log
All documentation is in the script itself.

I set up this repo for [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/aavocr/after_6_months_of_testing_this_in_my_company_i/).

If you have made any improvments to the script i'd be happy if you share them back. This thing was used internally only, so a lot of it is still ugly hacks and duplicated strings.
